# UcBerkeley-IndustryEng135
Data-X is an advanced project course.  The skillset learned in this course can be applied to a broad range of industry sectors and applications.  A key part of the course is an open-ended project.  The first 4 weeks are used to generate a story and low-tech demo for a real-world project.  The remaining 8 weeks are used for an agile sprint which results in a demonstration of working project code by the end of the course.
